A series of jQuery UI custom widgets for the bugswarm platform

Aiming to abstract away the details of filtering a bugswarm feed for data
Eventually to be populated with a widget for every type of sensor data we support.

See [test.html](http://github.com/theterg/bugswarm-widget/blob/master/examples/test.html) for a current example.
